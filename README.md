## My Portfolio
This project is a personal portfolio website that I created using Nuxt3 and TypeScript. The website connects to the GitHub API to fetch my repositories and display them on the website. The website is styled using Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework. Overall, the project showcases my skills in web development, including my proficiency in Nuxt3, TypeScript, and API integration.
